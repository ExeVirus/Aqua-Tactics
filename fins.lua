//Fins.lua implements the wearable item, fins. 
//When worn, this item makes the user faster underwater, 
//...but slower out of the water.

//It also has a configurable wear value, typically set to 300 seconds (5 minutes), feel free to modify as you see fit

//Uses on-register globalstep to verify when you are on land or in water.
